# Calendly Front-End Clone

I enjoyed scheduling an appointment using Calendly, so I decided to clone it! 

Users should be able to select a date, select a time-slot, and register for an appointment.

I used FullCalendar to implement a calendar. 

I used sessionStorage to pass along the event details.
